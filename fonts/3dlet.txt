Thanks for Downloading 3D LET.

  This Font is based on the 3D N of the Nintendo 64 Logo.  The only
problem was that the N64's N is connected to make it look cube-like.
Trying to make the rest of the characters look connected wasn't working
out, so I made all of the characters 'Offset' instead of connected.

--All of the lower case letters and #'s are 'Outline' charascters.
--All of the Upper case letters and Shift+#'s are 'Solid' characters.
>>>(Shift+# means use !@#$%^&*() for the #'s 1234567890)

  When Printing with this Font, use a large point size (above 24 pt.)

INSTALLING FONTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  There's a couple of ways to install Fonts. The 'easy' way to
install fonts is to just Unzip/place the font file [.ttf] into your
Windows\Fonts directory (I always use this method). If you're unable
to do it the 'easy' way, then try to do it this way (for Windows
95/98/NT):

1] Unzip the Font(s) to a folder (or somewhere, just remember where
you unzipped it) on your Computer.

2] Next, click on the START button, then select SETTINGS then
CONTROL PANEL.

3] When the Control Panel Window pops up, Double Click on FONTS.

4] When the FONTS window pops up, select File then Install New Font...

5] A Add Fonts window will pop up, just go to the folder that you
unzipped the Font(s) to, select the Font(s) and then click on OK.
Now the Font(s) are installed.

  Now you can use the Font(s) in programs the utilize Fonts.  Make
sure that you install the font(s) first, then open up your apps
(so the app will recognize the font).    Sometimes you'll have to
wait until you computer 'auto-refreshes' for programs to recognize
fonts (Windows is sometimes slow to do that).  You can refresh your
computer quicker by going into Windows Explorer -or- My Computer and
press ALT + V, then R (or in the menubar select VIEW then REFRESH).
